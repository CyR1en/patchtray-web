/**
 * Serves the published stable-channel installer feed to the browser.
 *
 * The download service returns the feed without CORS headers, so the site
 * cannot read the manifest directly. This function fetches it server-side and
 * lets the Vercel edge cache absorb the traffic (5 min fresh, stale served for
 * a day while it revalidates). The feed itself is `no-store`, since the
 * launcher must always see the current pointer; the site only needs a version
 * number, so caching it at the edge here is safe.
 *
 * Plain JavaScript on purpose: Vercel compiles `api/*.ts` with the project's
 * own `typescript`, and TypeScript 7 dropped the classic JS compiler API that
 * compile step calls — it fails the deploy with "Cannot read properties of
 * undefined (reading 'readFile')". A .js function skips that path entirely.
 *
 * The manifest is forwarded as published. `parseLatestRelease` in
 * `src/lib/release.ts` is the single validator, since it has to vet the
 * build-time seed anyway; a malformed manifest leaves the site on its
 * configured fallback either way. Keep this URL in step with
 * `LATEST_MANIFEST_URL` there.
