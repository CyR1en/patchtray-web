## PatchTray

PatchTray connects an input, a live VST3 processing chain, and an output from
one logical duplex audio device in a visual route. It supports compatible
duplex ASIO and DirectSound devices, plus Windows Audio in Shared, Exclusive,
and Low Latency modes. VoiceMeeter Patch Inserts are an optional
expanded multichannel workflow. Processing can continue while the application
is minimized to the Windows system tray.

Installers and updater metadata are served from the PatchTray download service.
The public release repository carries release notes, approved media assets, and
issue tracking:
